        id="Assert"
        severity="Warning"
        message="Assertions are unreliable in Dalvik and unimplemented in ART. Use `BuildConfig.DEBUG` conditional checks instead."
        category="Correctness"
        priority="6"
        summary="Assertions"
        explanation="Assertions are not checked at runtime. There are ways to request that they be used by Dalvik \&#xA;(`adb shell setprop debug.assert 1`), but note that this is not implemented in ART (the newer \&#xA;runtime), and even in Dalvik the property is ignored in many places and can not be relied upon. \&#xA;Instead, perform conditional checking inside `if (BuildConfig.DEBUG) { }` blocks. That constant \&#xA;is a static final boolean which is true in debug builds and false in release builds, and the \&#xA;Java compiler completely removes all code inside the if-body from the app.&#xA;&#xA;For example, you can replace `assert speed > 0` with `if (BuildConfig.DEBUG &amp;&amp; !(speed > 0)) { \&#xA;throw new AssertionError() }`.&#xA;&#xA;(Note: This lint check does not flag assertions purely asserting nullness or non-nullness; these \&#xA;are typically more intended for tools usage than runtime checks.)"
